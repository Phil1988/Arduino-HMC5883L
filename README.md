In the near future Korneliusz Jarzębski plans to refactoring the libraries. The main goal is to improve code quality, new features and add support for different versions of Arduino boards like Uno, Mega and Zero.

For this purpose he needs to buy modules, Arduino Boards and lot of beer. 

If you want to support the further and long-term development of libraries, please help him.

You can do this by transferring any amount to his PayPal account: paypal@jarzebski.pl

Thanks!
